/* NOTES and ideas

1. Anthony

make a dynamic predicate called
opponentsCards(player,card,probability)

ADD all YOUR cards with prob 100

when a player shows YOU a card during your turn it is added with probability of 100

when a player holds up a card to beat the guess of another player

case 1: no other opponent has any of the three cards
ALL three possible cards are added with a probabilty of 30

case 2: one of the cards is held by another opponent w/ prob 100
two unheld cards are added with a probability of 50

case 3: two of the cards are held by opponents w/ prob 100
unheld card is added to player w/ prob 100

case 4: cards are held by other players with a percentage < 100
each card (A,B,C) is assigned 30% * (100%-percentage of card being held by others)




2. Jessyka

Keep track of room distances from player

when you enter a room all the room values should also change based on the absolute distance from the room you are currently in. so say you have room(kitchen,1) room(study,0) room(library,2) then you go into the libraryâ€¦ it becomes: room(library,2) room(study,1) room(kitchen,4)

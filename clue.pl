/* NOTES and ideas

1. Bugs with Probability. What if player holding up cards contains a probability already.
1a. Fix Best Guess Function (should have the lowest SUM of probabilities)


2. Jessyka

Keep track of room distances from player

when you enter a room all the room values should also change based on the absolute distance from the room you are currently in. so say you have room(kitchen,1) room(study,0) room(library,2) then you go into the libraryâ€¦ it becomes: room(library,2) room(study,1) room(kitchen,4)
